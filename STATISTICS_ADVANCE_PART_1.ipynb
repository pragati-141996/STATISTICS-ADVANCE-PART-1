        "-  A Probability Distribution Function (PDF) is a function that describes how the probabilities are distributed over the values of a continuous random variable.A PDF tells us how likely it is that a continuous random variable falls within a certain range.It does not give the probability at a single point (since that‚Äôs always 0 for continuous variables).Instead, the area under the curve of the PDF over an interval gives the probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "-  A Probability Density Function (PDF) is used with continuous random variables to describe how the probability is distributed across values. It does not give the probability of a specific value, because in continuous cases, the probability at any exact point is zero. Instead, the PDF gives the density of the probability around that point. To find the actual probability that a value falls within a certain range, you need to calculate the area under the curve of the PDF over that interval.In contrast, a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) gives the actual probability that the random variable is less than or equal to a certain value. It tells you the total accumulated probability from the start up to that value. The CDF is always a number between 0 and 1 and is always increasing. While the PDF describes the shape or spread of the probability, the CDF shows how the probability builds up over time or across values.So, while the PDF tells you how dense the probability is at a point, the CDF tells you how much probability has accumulated up to that point.\n",

        "-  A Discrete Uniform Distribution is a type of probability distribution where all outcomes are equally likely.

        "-  A Bernoulli distribution is a probability distribution that models an experiment with exactly two possible outcomes: success (usually represented by 1) and failure (usually represented by 0). In this distribution, the probability of success is denoted by p and the probability of failure is 1-p.The key properties of the Bernoulli distribution include its mean (expected value), which is simply the probability of success p,and its variance,which is given by p(1-p).This variance represents the spread or variability of the outcomes and is highest when p=0.5,meaning the two outcomes are equally likely. The probability mass function (PMF) of a Bernoulli distribution gives the probabilities of the two possible outcomes, with P(X=1)=p for success and P(X=0)=1-p for failure. If p=0.5, the distribution is symmetric, meaning the outcomes have equal probabilities, whereas if ùëù‚â†0.5 the distribution is asymmetric, with one outcome being more likely than the other. The moment generating function (MGF) of a Bernoulli distribution is ùëÄx(ùë°)=1‚àíùëù+ùëùùëít,which is useful in deriving moments like the mean and variance for more advanced applications.\n",

        "14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?\n",
        "-   The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is deeply connected to the normal distribution because it explains why sample means (averages of random samples) from any population tend to follow a normal distribution under certain conditions.Regardless of the shape of the original population distribution (whether it‚Äôs skewed, uniform, or any other shape), the distribution of sample means (the average from random samples) will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size n increases.This happens even if the original population itself is not normally distributed.If you take smaller sample sizes, the distribution of sample means may not look perfectly normal.But as you increase the sample size, the distribution of sample means gets closer and closer to a normal distribution.\n",

        "-   The Z-score is used to build confidence intervals when the population standard deviation (œÉ) is known or the sample size is large.A confidence interval is a range that estimates a population parameter (like a mean) based on a sample.The Z-score tells us how many standard errors to go above and below the sample mean to create that range.The larger the confidence level, the larger the Z-score, and the wider the interval.(Z-score = how confident you want to be and Confidence interval = the range you give using that Z-score).\n",

        "\n",
        "21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n",
        "-   The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a powerful concept in statistics, but it only works correctly when certain assumptions are met. First, the data must be collected through random sampling, meaning every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This ensures that the sample is unbiased and representative. Additionally, the observations in the sample must be independent, which means that the value of one data point should not influence or depend on the value of another. Independence ensures that the variability in the data truly reflects randomness.Another important assumption is that the sample size should be large enough. While there is no fixed rule, a common guideline is that the sample size n should be at least 30, especially when the underlying population\n",
        "distribution is not normal. This large sample size helps \"smooth out\" irregularities and allows the sampling distribution of the mean to approach a normal shape. Also, the population from which the sample is drawn must have a finite mean and finite variance; otherwise, the average and spread of the data might be undefined, making the CLT invalid.Finally, in most versions of the CLT, the data should be identically distributed, meaning that each sample comes from the same population distribution. This ensures consistency across the sample. When all these conditions are satisfied, the CLT guarantees that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, even if the original population distribution is not. This makes the theorem extremely useful in real-world statistical analysis and inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        "-   The expected value (EV), often called the mean or expected outcome, of a probability distribution is the average value you would expect to get if you repeated an experiment or process an infinite number of times. It provides a weighted average of all possible outcomes, with the weights being the probabilities of those outcomes. For a discrete random variable, the expected value is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and summing these products. In the case of continuous random variables, it involves an integral of the outcome multiplied by the probability density function (PDF).The expected value is significant because it gives the long-term average result of repeated trials. For example, when tossing a fair coin, the expected value of the outcome is 0.5 (considering heads as 1 and tails as 0). This concept helps in decision-making processes, as it allows individuals to make informed choices based on the likely outcomes of uncertain events. Additionally, the expected value is foundational for calculating the variance and standard deviation, which measure how spread out the values are from the expected result. Overall, the expected value offers a way to understand the central tendency of a probability distribution, providing insight into what outcome to anticipate on average.\n",

        "23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",
        "-   A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes for a random variable. The expected outcome, or expected value, is a specific measure derived from the probability distribution. It represents the average value you would expect to obtain if the random experiment were repeated many times.\n",
        "-  Probability Distribution Provides the Framework:A probability distribution assigns probabilities to each possible outcome of a random variable.For example, in a discrete probability distribution (like a die roll), the probability distribution tells you the probability of rolling a 1, 2, 3, etc.In a continuous probability distribution (like the normal distribution), it describes the probabilities of outcomes within a range of values, such as heights, weights, or temperatures.\n",
        "-    Expected Value as a Weighted Average:The expected value is the weighted average of all possible outcomes, where each outcome is weighted by its probability.\n",
        "-    Relating the Two:The probability distribution describes all possible outcomes and their likelihoods, while the expected value gives a single number that summarizes the central tendency of those outcomes.The expected value gives us an idea of where the center of the probability distribution lies, i.e., it tells us what outcome we would expect on average, considering the probabilities of each outcome.If the distribution is skewed, the expected value will be pulled toward the tail with the higher probability. In a symmetric distribution, the expected value will typically be at the center.\n",
